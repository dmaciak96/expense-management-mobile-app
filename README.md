# Expense Management Android App
Managing shared expenses with friends has never been easier. This app helps you keep track of who paid for what, split costs fairly, and avoid awkward money conversations.
Create balance groups, invite your friends, and add any expenses you want to share - the app will automatically divide the costs equally among all members. No more manual calculations, no more confusion, no more “who owes whom.”
You’ll never have to wonder who owes what ever again!
